        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>My personal goals focus on achieving academic excellence and developing effective time management skills to balance studies and extracurricular activities. I prioritize continuous learning, health, and well-being, while also acquiring new skills for future career growth. Financial responsibility is important, so I&#39;m learning to manage personal expenses wisely</p>
        <p>Regarding my parents, I aim to show respect and maintain open communication. I express gratitude for their support and help with household chores. Keeping them informed about my academic progress and seeking their guidance are key, as is balancing their expectations with my own aspirations.</p>
